* ⚗️ELIXIR! ⚗️
λ conf 2017 workshop
* "Aldric!"
That's me.

Yell that when you're stuck.

Send flames to /dev/null.
* Getting in groups and group intros
Get in groups of four.
Prefer people you don't know.
- Your name
- How you like to receive help
- Your familiarity with functional programming
* Workshop structure
- 3x(25 minutes of work + 5-minute break)
- 15-minute break
- rinse and repeat
- also, food somewhere
* Getting familiar with codio
- log in
- set up Elixir VM
* SMALL BREAK
* The documentation
Teach a 👤 to 🐟 ...

https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#content

This will likely come in handy.
* REPL work
** Entering the repl

** REPL / mapping Exercises
*** Each
Take this data structure and create the following output:
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
  beatles = ["john", "paul", "george", "ringo", "stu"]

  # output:
  #=> 'john fondly remembers doing amphetamines in Hamburg'
  #=> 'paul fondly remembers doing amphetamines in Hamburg'
  #=> 'george fondly remembers doing amphetamines in Hamburg'
  #=> 'ringo fondly remembers doing amphetamines in Hamburg'
  #=> 'stu fondly remembers doing amphetamines in Hamburg'
#+END_SRC
*** Map
Take this data structure and create the following output:
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
beatles = ["john", "paul", "george", "ringo", "stu"]

# output:
#=> ["John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo", "Stu"]
#+END_SRC
*** Squares and Hash
Write code that:
- Prompts the user for a minimum and maximum number.
- Generates a Hash that has key-value pairs, or entries, where.
  - Each key in a pair is a integer between the min and max entered.
  - Each value in the pair is the square of key in that pair.
(hint: use =Enum.reduce/3=)
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
# with a min and max of 2 and 4, respectively, the resulting hash would be:
a = %{1=>1, 2=>4, 3=>9}
#+END_SRC
* SMALL BREAK
* Recursion, pattern matching, guard clauses
** Pattern matching
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def bar(1) do
    IO.puts "hey hey"
  end
  def bar(2) do
    IO.puts "yah yah"
  end
end
#+END_SRC
** Pattern matching, anonymous function
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
function = fn
   1 -> IO.puts "That was a one"
   2 -> IO.puts "That was a two"
   _ -> IO.puts "I don't care what that was."
end
#+END_SRC
** Recursion
Just pattern matching. Function definition order may matter.
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
defmodule Foo do
  def recurse([], acc) do
    IO.puts acc
  end

  def recurse(list) do
    recurse(list, 0)
  end

  def recurse([head | tail], acc) do
    recurse(tail, acc + head)
  end
end
#+END_SRC
** Guard clauses on functions
I refer to this page a /lot/.
http://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/case-cond-and-if.html#expressions-in-guard-clauses
- =def(x) when x > 5=
- =def(x) when x < 0=
- =def(x)=
** Fibonacci
Write recursive code that computes a Fibonacci number.
The Fibonacci series is defined as:

- n(x) where x < 1 = undefined
- n(1) = 1
- n(2) = 1
- n(x) = n(x-1) + n(x+2)
** Fizzbuzz exercise
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
* SMALL BREAK
* Combining functions
** Pipelining
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
(1..100)
|> Enum.filter(fn(x) -> rem(x, 2) == 0 end) # Modulo operator!
|> Enum.map(fn(x) -> x * 2 end)
#+END_SRC
** Pipeline exercises
Write a pipeline that:
- removes odd numbers from a list
- squares the remaining numbers
- divides them by two
- removes the even numbers.

Note that =5/2= may yield a floating-point number so you might want to use =div(5, 2)= instead.

* Guess the number
Write a module that lets you play a game of guessing a number. To let the computer choose a random number, use something like =Enum.random(1..10)=.
You might want to use the pipelines to transform the user's input into an integer.
* LONG BREAK
* Rock, paper, scissors
** Basic game
Write a module that lets you determine the winner of a two-player game of rock, paper, scissors. The inputs could be =:rock=, =:paper=, =:scissors=. The outputs could be =:player1=, =:player2=, =:draw=.

Remember that:
- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock
** Rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock
Copy the previous code over to a new file and tweak the rules so that:
- Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock; he is poisoned by lizard and disproven by paper.
- Lizard poisons Spock and eats paper; it is crushed by rock and decapitated by scissors.
* GenServers
** Cast and Call
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
defmodule MyServer do
  use GenServer

  def handle_cast({:ping, x}, state) do
    :timer.sleep 2000
    IO.inspect x
    {:noreply, state}
  end

  def handle_call({:ping, x}, _from, state) do
    :timer.sleep 2000
    IO.inspect x
    {:reply, :hello_world, state}
  end
end

{:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(MyServer, nil) # nil means store nil as state
GenServer.cast(pid, {:ping, "hello, world"})
GenServer.call(pid, {:ping, "hello, world"})
#+END_SRC

** State
#+BEGIN_SRC elixir
defmodule MyServer do
  use GenServer

  def handle_call({:add_name, name}, _from, state) do
    {:reply, :ok, [name | state]}
  end

  def handle_call(:greetings, _from, state) do
    greetings = Enum.map(state, fn(x) -> "Hello, #{x}!" end)
    {:reply, {:ok, greetings}, state}
  end
end

{:ok, pid} = GenServer.start_link(MyServer, nil) # nil means store nil as state
:ok = GenServer.call(pid, {:add_name, "Kathew"})
:ok = GenServer.call(pid, {:add_name, "Lichard"})
{:ok, greetings} = GenServer.call(pid, :greetings)
#+END_SRC
** Rock-paper-scissors ... As a Service
Create a GenServer that lets you play RPS and keeps track of the number of wins for each player as well as a percentage of time each player chose.
* SMALL BREAK
* Rock Paper Scissors, many processes
Make it possible to change between rulesets, and preserve stats for each rulesets while the game is running (don't worry about storing anything).
Maybe each ruleset/stats is a separate process and you can store the pid as part of the state of the game process?
Maybe you store all the pids in the game state and you send a message to switch to another ruleset.
* SMALL BREAK
* RPS, many processes, part 2
* SMALL BREAK
* Supervisors & Applications
** Won't show supervisors outside an application for simplicity
Supervisors manage processes
** An application is a reusable unit of code
Think "microservice" if you have to.
* Creating a project
=mix new foo --sup=
** App not always a process tree
In this case, for didactic purposes
** directory tree

* The = operator
Acts as both assignment and pattern-matching operator.
- a = 5 # ⇒ 5 (assignment)
- 5 = a # ⇒ 5 (pattern match)
- 6 = a # ⇒ MatchError
- ^a = 5 # ⇒ 5 (pattern match)
- ^a = 6 # ⇒ MatchError
Significantly less of a problem than one thinks it might becomes.
* The =with= keyword
This is how you would implement railway programming.
